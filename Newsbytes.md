## GeoGuesser
* guessing geolocation with photos

## DeepVoice by Baidu
* Text-to-speech system constructed entirely from deep neural networks as compared to modern TTS which arecomplex, multi-stage processing pipelines, each of which may rely on hand-engineered features and heuristics
* Less labour intensive and easier to program
